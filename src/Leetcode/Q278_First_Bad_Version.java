/**
 * Created by rbhatnagar2 on 1/15/17.
 *
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
 * all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one,
 * which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad.
 *
 * Implement a function to find the first bad version.
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
 *
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 *
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(log(n))
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
